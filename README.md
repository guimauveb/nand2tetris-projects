### nand2tetris course - projects completed

nand2tetris taught me a lot about boolean algebra, how low level stuff works and how simple pieces put together in a 
simple and elegant way can make a fully functional computer. Even though modern processors are much more 
complicated it teaches a lot about the fundamentals needed to understand how computers work at the lowest level 
(above the transistor level).

**I've completed projects up to number 8.**  
IMO the most challenging and rewarding one are building the RAM / ALU / CPU in the hardware section and building
the assembler / VM translator in the software section.  

At the time I completed the projects I made sure they passed all the tests included. So everything should work.
